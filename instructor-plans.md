## Activity

[This CodePen](https://codepen.io/anythingcodes/pen/xdGNZg?editors=0010) will be used as the basis for the activity and any trivia questions.

## Schedule

- 6:30-6:35: Intro &amp; Welcome
- 6:35-7pm: Presentation Part 1
    - Background and terminology for ES6
    - Six functional enhancements of ES6
- 7-8:15pm: Hands-On Activity
- 8:15-8:25pm: Presentation Part 2
    - Transpilation
- 8:25-8:30pm: Wrap-up, reflection, next steps
- 8:30-9pm: Clean up 

## Class Format
- Break students into groups of 4-5
- Each group receives a printout with a set of activities. Each activity is worth X points. At the end, one team wins!

## Requirements for completing Activity:
- const and let
- Classes and subclasses (Product, Cart, ProductInCart)
- Destructuring
- Default parameters
    - Enforcing mandatory parameters
- Template strings
- Common array helpers (find, map, forEach, perhaps the less well-known reduce)
- Fetch helper
